            <p>The European Union (EU) is a union of European countries. This union was founded on November 1, 1993, with the Maastricht Treaty. The EU aims to promote peace, stability, and economic prosperity among its member states. It has expanded over the years and currently consists of 27 member countries. The EU has its own institutions, such as the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council of the European Union, which work together to make decisions and develop policies for the benefit of all member states. One of the key achievements of the EU is the establishment of a single market, allowing for the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people within its borders. Additionally, the EU plays a significant role in areas such as trade, environmental protection, and human rights.</p>
