            <p>Imagining how the European Union will be in the future, including in 2030, is challenging because the EU can take various paths. However, let's discuss some of the potential future developments:

                In 2023/2024, it is possible that Moldova could join the EU.
                In 2024, the Ukraine-Russia war might come to an end, with Ukraine winning but having to yield some regions to Russia. After the war, Ukraine could potentially seek EU membership.
                By 2025, there could be significant progress in improving energy efficiency, with many houses having modern energy-efficient standards. Additionally, urban areas could undergo restoration efforts.
                Before 2030, it is plausible that the EU could undergo institutional changes, such as the establishment of a President of the European Union, along with a revised constitution and the development of a common EU defense capability.
                Before 2040, to compete with other global superpowers, there could be discussions about transforming the EU into a federal entity, similar to the United States of America. Potential names for such a federal EU could be the European Federation or the United States of Europe. This idea may be seen as necessary for smaller EU member states like France, Italy, or Germany to maintain influence against larger powers like China, Russia, and the USA.
                In the distant future, it is conceivable that Russia could consider joining the EU. However, as long as Russia continues to uphold a fascist regime, it is unlikely to gain EU membership.
                Please note that these speculations about the future are based on hypothetical scenarios and should be taken as such. The actual trajectory of the EU will be influenced by numerous factors, including political dynamics, global events, and the will of its member states.</p>
