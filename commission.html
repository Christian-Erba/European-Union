            <p>The European Commission is the executive branch of the European Union (EU) and one of its main institutions. It plays a crucial role in shaping EU policies, implementing decisions, and managing the day-to-day affairs of the EU.

                The Commission is composed of a college of Commissioners, with each Commissioner representing a specific member state. The number of Commissioners is currently limited to one per member state, totaling 27. The President of the European Commission is elected by the European Parliament and appointed by the European Council.
                The Commission's primary responsibilities include proposing legislation, implementing EU policies and decisions, enforcing EU law, representing the EU in international negotiations, and managing the EU's budget. It acts independently of national governments and seeks to promote the general interest of the EU as a whole.
                The Commission's decision-making process involves initiating proposals, which are then examined and debated by other EU institutions, such as the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The Commission also oversees the implementation of EU policies and monitors compliance by member states.
                Furthermore, the Commission acts as the guardian of the EU treaties and ensures that EU law is applied consistently across member states. It has the power to investigate potential breaches of EU law and can take legal action against member states or other entities that fail to comply.</p>
